Puliamo Terlizzi
================

This project is part of my personal challenge of writing something new in the total time of 2 hours.

This project is heavily based on some other amazing projects:

* Mezzanine + GeoDjango
* Bootleaf
* django-geojson
* OpenStreetMap data

Install
-------

* install SQlite
* install SpatiaLite
* install PySQlite `compiling it with C bindings`_

then

.. code-block:: bash

  ./manage.py syncdb
